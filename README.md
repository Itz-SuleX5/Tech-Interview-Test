# Product list with cart

![Design preview for the Product list with cart coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS/SASS and JavaScript/React.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this product list project that includes a functional cart and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

We provide the data for the products in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to populate the UI dynamically if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- When the user clicks on a single product, show the product details in a new page that the user can navigate to and also add the product to the cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.
- Add related images to the product details page and create a carousel of the product images.

## Bonus Points

- Use json-server to create a fake API for the product data.
- Create a dynamic checkout page that shows the user their cart items and their total cost before checkout.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project using the Figma design files provided. You will find the design file in the `/design` folder.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

1. Using Git create a new repository on your GitHub account. This is where you'll store your code for this project.
2. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
4. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

There are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with the instructions on how to run the project locally, once you have finished the challenge.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
